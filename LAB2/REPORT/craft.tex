In this laboratory exercise, I focus on implementing edge detection techniques using NumPy. The experiments begin with color images represented in the RGB space,

𝑓
(
𝑥
,
𝑦
)
=
[
𝑅
(
𝑥
,
𝑦
)
,
 
𝐺
(
𝑥
,
𝑦
)
,
 
𝐵
(
𝑥
,
𝑦
)
]
,
f(x,y)=[R(x,y),G(x,y),B(x,y)],

which are converted to grayscale intensity images before further processing. The grayscale image is computed using a standard luminance model,

𝐼
(
𝑥
,
𝑦
)
=
0.299
 
𝑅
+
0.587
 
𝐺
+
0.114
 
𝐵
,
I(x,y)=0.299R+0.587G+0.114B,

and all edge detection algorithms operate exclusively on the resulting function 
𝐼
(
𝑥
,
𝑦
)
I(x,y).
