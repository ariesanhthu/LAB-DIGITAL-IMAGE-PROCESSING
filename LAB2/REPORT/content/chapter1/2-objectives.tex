\section{Objectives}

The main objectives of this assignment are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement several edge detection techniques using NumPy.
    \item Compare the results from the NumPy implementations and the neural network with PyTorch’s built-in functions.
    \item Train a basic neural network model to perform learning-based edge detection. Using dataset from Kaggle.
    \item Evaluate the performance of the edge detection techniques with metrics: mAP, ODS, OIS.
\end{itemize}
