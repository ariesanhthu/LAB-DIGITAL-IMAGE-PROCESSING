\chapter{Dataset Preparation and Preprocessing}

\section{Dataset Description}
The dataset used in this laboratory is derived from an MNIST-like image collection, where handwritten digit images are stored in folder structures corresponding to labels from 0 to 9.
Each image is converted to grayscale and resized to $28 \times 28$ pixels.

\section{CSV Dataset Construction}
\subsection{Image-to-CSV Conversion}
To simplify training, images are converted into a CSV format where each row contains:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A label column representing the digit class.
    \item 784 pixel intensity values flattened from the $28 \times 28$ image.
\end{itemize}

Pixel values are optionally normalized to the range $[0, 1]$ by dividing by 255.

\subsection{Dataset Splits}
Two dataset configurations are generated:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Training Sample}: 600 images used for rapid experimentation.
    \item \textbf{Training Set}: 42,000 images used for full-scale training.
\end{itemize}
